taskboard
=========

A simple task board that I could use instead of my analog one at work.

This app is bases on [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) using [Bower](http://bower.io/) for dependency management and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to build it. It has been genereated using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and its [Generator for Polymer](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-polymer).
